## Introduction

This R Markdown demonstrates causal analysis techniques for evaluating public health interventions in Ontario using Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and CausalImpact.

## Packages

library(tidyverse)
library(MatchIt)
library(broom)
library(CausalImpact)
```

## Data Import

Describe and import data from open sources (e.g., StatsCan tables, public health datasets).

## Data Cleaning and EDA

Explain and perform data cleaning steps and exploratory data analysis.

## Propensity Score Matching

Implement PSM using MatchIt to balance covariates between treated and control groups.

## Difference-in-Differences

Estimate treatment effects using a DiD regression model with robust standard errors.

## Causal Impact Analysis

Use the CausalImpact package to validate findings with a Bayesian structural time-series model.

## Results and Discussion

Summarize findings and discuss implications for policy makers.
